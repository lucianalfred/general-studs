*   <Linting Tools
Linting tools such as JS Lint,1 JS Hint,2 and ES Lint3 can be used to test the
quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode. They are designed to
highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain
if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented. They
can be very unforgiving and use some opinionated coding conventions, such as
not using the ++ and -- increment operators (in the case of JS Lint). Linting tools
are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide. This is particularly
useful when you are working in a team, as it ensures everybody follows the same
conventions.
Itâ€™s possible to add a linting tool as a text-editor plugin; this will then highlight
any sloppy code as you type. Another option is to use an online linting tool that
allows you to simply paste onto a page for feedback. Another option is to install
linting software on your computer using npm. This can then be run as part of
your workflow.
Passing a lint test is no guarantee that your code is correct, but it will mean it will
be more consistent and less likely to have problems.
